# THINC-NN-1D-Multiphase
1D 6 equation model to solve multi-phase flows using THINC-NN and SSPRK2
This code uses eta_i+1/2(refer Self-adjusting steepness-based schemes that preserve
discontinuous structures in compressible flows
Zhiwei He a , Yucang Ruan b,c , Yaqun Yu d , Baolin Tian a,e,âˆ—, Feng Xiao f) to estimate smoothness indicator as an input to NN which outputs value of beta.

Tested for 1D test cases.

Works well for interface advections(better than beta = log(3) and as good as if not better than beta = 1.6)
